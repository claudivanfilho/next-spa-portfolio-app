Technologies and Concepts Utilized in This Project:

- Next 13 + React 18 + Typescript + Tailwind
- i18n With `react-intl`
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) Tests
- Continuous Integration - Github Actions
- Branch Preview With Vercel Configured
- SWR Cache Strategy
- MSW Server Mocking Strategy

## General App Strategy

This app is a sample application of a Single Page Application (SPA) using Next.js, as recommended by [react.dev](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks), for initiating a new project. The project aims to utilize only React features and not Next.js features, with the intent of focusing on front-end skills.

The app uses an immutable API called [POKE API](https://pokeapi.co/), and for caching requests and optimizing website performance, I have chosen to adopt the MSW cache strategy.

#### Navigation

In this app, I am using the `react-router-dom` library to handle routes and layouts. All the existing routes can be observed in the `App.tsx` file.

#### Internationalization

For internationalization, I am utilizing `react-intl` along with automatic language detection, provided in the `LocaleContext` file.

#### State Management

For state management, I am using the React Context API with custom hooks to be used inside my components. The only things necessary for global state management are the `intl` and `locale`.

## Testing strategy

In all of my Front End projects (SPAs), I prefer to follow the [testing trophy](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications) strategy, which prioritizes [integrated tests over unit tests](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests).

All test cases are behaviorally oriented, following the principles of [Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/behavior-driven-development-bdd-and-functional-testing-62084ad7f1f2), with a focus on capturing user interactions with the system.
